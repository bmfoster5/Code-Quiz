# Code-Quiz

## Description

Hello! I have created a coding quiz! Take a look and let me know what you think.

- My motivation for this project is to showcase what I learned with the introduction to web APIs! 
- I learned that through creating functions and calling on HTML elements, I can make a webpage functional and interactive. 
- With the help of DOM traversal, time intervals, eventlisteners, and local storage, I can create an interactive webpage that stores past results.
